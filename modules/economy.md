# What is it?
The Economy module is a powerful feature for Discord servers looking to add an interactive and engaging experience for their users. This module allows users to earn and spend virtual currency within the server, creating a sense of progress and accomplishment.

The module includes a variety of commands such as:
- `/daily` which allows users to earn a set amount of currency each day they log in
- `/pay` which allows users to transfer currency to other users
- `/shop` which enables users to purchase virtual items or roles with the currency they have earned.

The module is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, making it simple for server administrators to set up and manage the economy. Additionally, it also includes analytics and tracking features to monitor the economy, allowing server administrators to see who is earning the most, who is spending the most, and who is buying what. This data can be used to improve the economy and make it more balanced, and also to create events or promotions that will attract more users.

The Economy module is a valuable addition for any Discord server looking to enhance user engagement and increase activity. It provides users with a sense of purpose and makes server management easier for the admins. By implementing this module, server administrators will be able to create an interactive and engaging experience for their users, keeping them interested and active in the server.
